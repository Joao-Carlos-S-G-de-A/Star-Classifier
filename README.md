Astronomy has rapidly evolved into a data-rich science, with missions such as Gaia mapping nearly 2
billion objects and LAMOST producing over 10 million spectra. These extensive surveys offer unprece-
dented opportunities to understand the universe, but their sheer volume makes manual classification
impractical. Machine learning has emerged as a crucial tool for analysing these large data sets, allowing
new insights from photometric, astrometric, and spectral information. In this study, we aim to apply ma-
chine learning to classify every star in the Milky Way by training a multimodal deep learning model on
classifications from the SIMBAD database, which includes nearly 20 million objects. Here, we propose
a novel algorithm that integrates multiple astronomical data types - such as astrometry, photometry, and
spectra - to classify stars with higher efficiency and accuracy. Our results will demonstrate the potential
and challenges of multimodal deep learning in achieving reliable classifications of previously unclassi-
fied objects, with the potential to significantly improve traditional methods relying on human inspection.
This approach bridges the gap between current cataloguing efforts and the need for rapid, automated
classification, thereby enriching our understanding of stellar populations. In a broader context, this
project advances the field of stellar classification by illustrating the value of integrating multimodal deep
learning into astronomy. It lays the groundwork for future studies that incorporate additional data types
and more complex datasets, providing a valuable tool for fields of observational astronomy that currently
rely on single-mode data.
